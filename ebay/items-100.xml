    <Description>Scripophily Makes a Great Gift for Everyone Our Stocks are worth the paper they're printed on (sm) Our Company is a TRUSTED Buyer and Seller of Old Stock Certificates. Check out our About Me Page , where you can find out about us and read the recent articles about our company in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post and our appearence on CNN. Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company's logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world's leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol "HRZ." Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

    <Description>I am selling a set of 6 coasters with different characters on them. One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink. There is a man in his green pajamas (I think) holding his head with stars swimming around his head (possibly a headache). Next is a couple of drunks sitting by a lamppost. And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve. The buyer will be responsible for shipping charges and insurance if requested. I need to hear from you within 3 days after auction ends. Payment must be received within 10 days. I accept money orders, cashier checks, or personal checks that will need to clear. Don't forget to check out the other coaster! Thanks for looking and good luck bidding. E-mail if you have questions.</Description>

Brand new, and mint in original box. The perfect item to show appreciation for a hard-working, little-thanked dad!! Sometimes a little token goes a long way toward showing a dad he's special, needed and loved. Corny? Probably. REAL? Definitely! In a society where "Cool Rules," REAL is the deal!! Bid now and let's get back to basics. NO Reserve, Low Opening Bid, Actual Priority Mail Shipping in the U.S., Actual AirMail to Europe and Canada. Usually NO RESERVE (unless otherwise noted), low opening bid, and Low Priced, Fast shipping. A quick word to our long time friends and customers as well as new: Other eBay dealers sell hose and other items, but not too many take the time to give you a good description and, perhaps, a little history, tips, etc...... We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we're happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You're An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You're Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We'll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don't Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You're Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don't like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy's Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy's Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

    <Description>This pretty talc tin is empty. It is from the California Perfume Co. 1997 Anniversary Keepsake line, named roses, roses. On the reverse of the tin is the story of David McConnell and how he started Avon. The tin is beginning to rust on the base and has some rust and scratches. This tin belonged to my sister for many years. I believe there is supposed to be a blue top to the tin, but it is gone. The top is rusting considerably, but it is still a pretty Avon memorabilia piece. Shipping and handling will be $2.20 for US sales. Please, no Paypal. Thanks for looking, and good luck!

    <Description>Here are 2 beautiful Christopher Radko-Trim A Tree- PINS. They both are the same and have Santa in his sleigh with a little elf helping him load up the sleigh with presents. There is a Christmas tree in the background. It has glitter on it to give it just enough sparkle to make this pin stand out. You're going to love wearing this pin!! It measures 2 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide and has a pin back. They are new, not used. You get 2 of the pins shown in the picture for one price, what a deal!!

    <Description>Very solid comic, no missing or loose pages, no folded page corners, minimal handling evidence, colors good inside and out, slight age browning at the page extremes. Has pinup/poster back page. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping. Simple. I accept PayPal payments! Now Available for International Users Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Letter to William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon, from someone signed "Maggie D." It appears the Mr. Hearst gave her a horse, but not the one she expected, and she is "upset"! It is dated, (1927). She sent him a photo of herself, with a haughty look and other "signs" that she is upset. This is a fascinating insight into a very mysterious man. I think this was probably from a family member, as he was dedicated to Marion davies at this time..(so I understand; he also was somewhat of a ladies man.) This is a unusual collectable. The picture is 8 1/4" by 10 1/4", and tinted. Will send in the U.S. for $5.00 Quote for abroad Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version Low cost image hosting and full service auction management solutions: AuctionWatch</Description>

    <Description>Solid comic, no loose or missing pages, not marked, page corners not folded, colors good inside and out. Has a little edge wear on the spine binding edge, other 3 edges very good, has slight forward roll and light age browning at the page exteriors but overall quite sound and good. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping. Simple. I accept PayPal payments! Now Available for International Users Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.
